I'm a software developer living and working in Warrington, England.

Software development has been a hobby of mine for the past 9 years and my job for the last 6, I love playing with new technologies and will happily learn a new one for a specific project. 

I am mainly a LAMP developer, having found this to be the most productive (in my opinion) and have been using this stack for 9 years building sites of all sizes. I have also been working with Node.js for the past 2 years which along with CoffeeScript is my new favourite stack.
