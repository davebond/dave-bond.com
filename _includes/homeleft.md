I'm a software developer living and working in Warrington, England.

Software development has been a hobby of mine for the past 8 years and my job for the last 5, I love playing with new technologies and will happily learn a new one for a specific project. 

I am mainly a LAMP web developer, having found this to be the most productive (in my opinion) and have been using this stack for 8 years building sites of all sizes. I have also been working with Node.js for the past 2 years which along with CoffeeScript, MongoDB and Redis is my new favourite stack.
